# Jet Training System

Webots provides a complete development environment to model, program, and simulate robots, vehicles, and mechanical systems. Modelica library for interactive simulation. Library for fault modelling in Modelica. The SMArtInt Library is designed to integrate various artificial intelligence (AI) models seamlessly into Modelica-based simulation tools. ModelicaGym toolbox was developed to employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving optimization and control tasks in Modelica models. This is the library for aerodynamics/flight-dynamics simulation of aircrafts. FlightGear is an atmospheric and orbital flight simulator used in aerospace research and industry. Its flight dynamics engine (JSBSim) can use Java with Fortran for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Free library for accessing the GNU Scientific Library functions via Modelica. Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS) refers to software programs and tools that are developed, maintained, and distributed under public licenses. Project AirSim is Microsoft's evolution of AirSim, an advanced simulation platform for building, training, and testing autonomous systems in high-fidelity virtual environments. Open DIS is an implementation of the Distributed Interactive Simulation. QPlane is a fixed wing flight simulation environment for reinforcement learning. Opentrack is a program for tracking user head rotation and transmitting it to flight simulation software. PyEfis is an Electronic Flight Information System written in Python. ExperimentalAvionics EFIS AHRS is an attitude and heading reference system module. BlueSky is a software tool for fast, real-time simulation of air traffic. OpenEaagles (now called MIXR, for "the Mixed Reality Simulation Platform") is a "multi-platform simulation platform designed to help engineers and software developers rapidly prototype and build robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications".
