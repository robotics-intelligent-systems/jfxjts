# Full Mission Simulator for Pilot Training

Flight dynamics library for Modelica. This is the library for aerodynamics/flight-dynamics simulation of aircrafts. FlightGear is an atmospheric and orbital flight simulator used in aerospace research and industry. Its flight dynamics engine (JSBSim) can use Java with Fortran for solving Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Free library for accessing the GNU Scientific Library functions via Modelica. Public Domain Aeronautical Software (PDAS) refers to software programs and tools that are developed, maintained, and distributed under public licenses. Project AirSim is Microsoft's evolution of AirSim, an advanced simulation platform for building, training, and testing autonomous systems in high-fidelity virtual environments. Open DIS is an implementation of the Distributed Interactive Simulation. QPlane is a fixed wing flight simulation environment for reinforcement learning. Opentrack is a program for tracking user head rotation and transmitting it to flight simulation software. PyEfis is an Electronic Flight Information System written in Python. ExperimentalAvionics EFIS AHRS is an attitude and heading reference system module. BlueSky is a software tool for fast, real-time simulation of air traffic. OpenEaagles is a "multi-platform simulation platform designed to help engineers and software developers rapidly prototype and build robust, scalable, virtual and constructive, and stand-alone and distributed simulation applications". LWJGL is a Java library that enables cross-platform access to popular native APIs useful in the development of graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan, bgfx), audio (OpenAL, Opus), parallel computing (OpenCL, CUDA) and XR (OpenVR, LibOVR, OpenXR) applications. This is a complementary project related to OpenBattleSim and consists of a standalone Scenario Generator that players will be able to use to create customized environments ready to use in OpenBattlesim. The Ukrainian Naval Aviation is a component of the Ukrainian Navy.
